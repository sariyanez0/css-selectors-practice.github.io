   <aside>
        <p class="hofstra">The atmosphere of Hofstra is like a traditional campus that has a very top notch academic building, labs and also experiential facilities. The whole campus is surrounded with greenery and residence halls. The location of the Long Island Campus is ideal because there is lots of room for sightseeing and also many internship opportunities.
	They are looking for hard-working applicants who will take what they have learned and put it back into the workforce. Also they are looking for students who have good grades as it is a moderately competitive school.
	I think I am a good candidate for this school but not the best as the grades portion I fall below the percentage of average. However I am a very hardworking person and that is something that this school looks for.

   <aside>
        <p class="farmingdale">Farmingdale is SUNYâ€™s largest applied science and technology college. The class size is relatively small and closer than normal. The school itself has over 70 plus organizations and clubs you can join as well as many sports teams to partake in. This school is looking for people who are hard working and will try their best to graduate. They also are looking for people who are on average good students. I think I am a good candidate for this school because I fall in the high below percentage of grades for this school as well as would do my hardest to graduate with my bachelors degree.

   <aside>
        <p class="nyccot">New York City College of Technology has a vibrant general education that helps students with being able to compete in the workforce once they graduate. This school is also very inclusive, respectful and very open-minded to all the students.
	They are looking for students who are dedicated to learn and graduate and be able to take what they have learned into the outside world to be able to grow and flourish. Also people who have good grades as this school is competitive as well just not as much as the other schools.
	I do not think I fit the bill of this school because the grades are below the percentage of being accepted. This means that this would not be a safe school to apply too, but overall I would be a very hardworking student who will definitely flourish in this type of atmosphere.
